# A simple React web app, a simple clone of Gmail.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for storage and Firebase as a backend.

## Description

This project was originally created and live streamed by [Sonny Sangha](https://www.youtube.com/@SonnySangha/), an incredible youtuber and React, Next.js developer, Papa React, as he calls himself :+1: .

I created the same clone by watching his video and learned many concepts on React, Redux, and Firebase.
The greatest part of this project is that it has real time updates of created emails when any mail is created and sent on Firebase.

## Screenshots

Here are a couple of screenshots, to get a glimpse of how the web app looks like when it is run.

This one is the first page that shows the gmail clone dashboard, email list:

This page is a screen that shows an open mail:
